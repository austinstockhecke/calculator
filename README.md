# Web Calculator

This is a simple calculator. This was a bit of a larger project for me, but it's really helped me understand JavaScript even more. The goal was figuring out how to save data while displaying previous data, and figuring out the logic on how to do all of that without a thousand conditions in if statements. 


Again, this project idea was forked from The Odin Project.
